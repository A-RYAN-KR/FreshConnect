## About The Project

**FreshConnect** tackles a core challenge in the local food industry: the disconnect between street food vendors and reliable suppliers. Vendors struggle to find fresh ingredients at fair prices, while suppliers lack a broad, organized market to sell their goods.

This platform serves as a centralized B2B marketplace built on a foundation of trust and transparency. It empowers vendors to make informed purchasing decisions and helps suppliers grow their business by reaching a wider, verified customer base.
